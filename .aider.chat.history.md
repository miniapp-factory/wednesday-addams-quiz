ROLE & GOAL
You are an expert web app and quiz creator. Build a fast, mobile-friendly personality quiz mini app themed around Wednesday (Netflix) and its upcoming/ongoing Season 2. The quiz should help fans discover:

“Which Wednesday Season 2 character are you?”

The app must be fun, replayable, and easy to share.

CORE CONCEPT

Quiz title: “Which Wednesday Season 2 Character Are You?”

Tone: Spooky, witty, and deadpan with a touch of dark humor, in the spirit of Wednesday Addams.

Characters to sort into (you choose 4–6 core options, for example):

Wednesday

Enid

Xavier

Bianca

Ajax

A “mystery wildcard” result (e.g., “You’re the shadow no one saw coming.”)

IMPORTANT:

Do not reveal or invent major plot spoilers.

Keep references high-level (personality traits, vibes, archetypes), not detailed episode summaries.

QUIZ STRUCTURE

7–10 multiple-choice questions.

Each question should:

Reflect a spooky, gothic school / supernatural vibe.

Map answers to different characters’ traits (e.g., introverted vs. extroverted, loyal vs. ruthless, chaotic vs. calculated).

You must:

Write all the questions and answers yourself.

Randomize the order of answers on each question.

Ensure each answer has a clear weight toward 1–2 characters.

RESULT LOGIC

Use a simple scoring system:

Each answer adds points to one or more characters.

At the end, the character with the highest score becomes the result.

If there is a tie, choose the character whose personality best fits the majority of answers or break ties randomly between the top matches.

Result page must include:

Character name.

A 2–3 sentence original description capturing their Season 2 vibe and why the user matches them (no spoilers).

A fun line like: “You’d feel right at home wandering Nevermore’s halls at midnight.”
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added in order to implement the quiz, generate the logo, and update the app metadata:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import and render the new quiz component.  
3. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that contains the quiz logic and UI.  
4. `mini-app/components/quiz-question.tsx` – new component for individual questions.  
5. `mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx` – new component for displaying the result.  
6. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – new file to describe the logo that should be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

I’ll need a few more files to build the quiz and generate the logo.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them:

1. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – the main quiz component.  
2. `mini-app/components/quiz-question.tsx` – component for a single question.  
3. `mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx` – component that shows the result.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – description file for the logo image.  

Once those are added, I’ll supply the changes to `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.
