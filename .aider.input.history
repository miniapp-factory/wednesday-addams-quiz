+Code the following app
+```
+ROLE & GOAL
+You are an expert web app and quiz creator. Build a fast, mobile-friendly personality quiz mini app themed around Wednesday (Netflix) and its upcoming/ongoing Season 2. The quiz should help fans discover:
+
+“Which Wednesday Season 2 character are you?”
+
+The app must be fun, replayable, and easy to share.
+
+CORE CONCEPT
+
+Quiz title: “Which Wednesday Season 2 Character Are You?”
+
+Tone: Spooky, witty, and deadpan with a touch of dark humor, in the spirit of Wednesday Addams.
+
+Characters to sort into (you choose 4–6 core options, for example):
+
+Wednesday
+
+Enid
+
+Xavier
+
+Bianca
+
+Ajax
+
+A “mystery wildcard” result (e.g., “You’re the shadow no one saw coming.”)
+
+IMPORTANT:
+
+Do not reveal or invent major plot spoilers.
+
+Keep references high-level (personality traits, vibes, archetypes), not detailed episode summaries.
+
+QUIZ STRUCTURE
+
+7–10 multiple-choice questions.
+
+Each question should:
+
+Reflect a spooky, gothic school / supernatural vibe.
+
+Map answers to different characters’ traits (e.g., introverted vs. extroverted, loyal vs. ruthless, chaotic vs. calculated).
+
+You must:
+
+Write all the questions and answers yourself.
+
+Randomize the order of answers on each question.
+
+Ensure each answer has a clear weight toward 1–2 characters.
+
+RESULT LOGIC
+
+Use a simple scoring system:
+
+Each answer adds points to one or more characters.
+
+At the end, the character with the highest score becomes the result.
+
+If there is a tie, choose the character whose personality best fits the majority of answers or break ties randomly between the top matches.
+
+Result page must include:
+
+Character name.
+
+A 2–3 sentence original description capturing their Season 2 vibe and why the user matches them (no spoilers).
+
+A fun line like: “You’d feel right at home wandering Nevermore’s halls at midnight.”
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
